## Test suites

### Rust unit and integration

```bash
cargo nextest run --release --features render --no-fail-fast
```

Crate-scoped:

```bash
cargo nextest run --release --features render -p obscura-cdp
cargo nextest run --release --features render -p obscura-browser
```

By name:

```bash
cargo nextest run --release --features render runtime_click_submit_prevent_default
```

Use `cargo nextest`, not `cargo test`. Runtime tests require process isolation
because the engine owns one V8 isolate per process. Render tests must run in
release mode; debug builds are not a fidelity or performance gate.

The PR performance smoke uses five interleaved samples and compares medians.
Median latency and peak RSS are independent hard gates: either ratio strictly
above `1.10x` the base fails CI, without an additional absolute-delta escape.
The threshold policy tests can be run with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/ci -p 'test_perf_smoke.py'
```

### CDP parity tests

`crates/obscura-cdp/tests/cdp_*.rs` exercise CDP methods end-to-end with a real `dispatch` call and an in-process HTTP server.

Pattern:

```rust
#[tokio::test(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn my_test() {
    std::env::set_var("OBSCURA_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK", "1");
    let url = serve_once().await;
    let mut ctx = CdpContext::new();
    let page_id = ctx.create_page();
    let session_id = "session-1";
    ctx.sessions.insert(session_id.to_string(), page_id.clone());

    cdp(&mut ctx, 1, "Page.navigate", json!({"url": url}), session_id).await;
    // assertions
}
```

`serve_once` and `cdp` helpers are copied across the parity tests; reuse them.

## Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=obscura=info  obscura serve
RUST_LOG=obscura=debug obscura serve
RUST_LOG=obscura_cdp=trace,obscura_browser=debug obscura serve
```

Logs go to stderr.

`--verbose` on any subcommand is equivalent to `RUST_LOG=obscura=info`.

## Driving the CDP server manually

```bash
obscura serve --port 9222 --verbose
```

In another shell:

```bash
wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:9222
> {"id":1,"method":"Target.createTarget","params":{"url":"about:blank"}}
> {"id":2,"method":"Target.attachToTarget","params":{"targetId":"...","flatten":true}}
> {"id":3,"sessionId":"...-session","method":"Page.navigate","params":{"url":"https://example.com"}}
> {"id":4,"sessionId":"...-session","method":"Runtime.evaluate","params":{"expression":"document.title"}}
```

Useful for reproducing what Puppeteer or Playwright is doing without their abstraction.

## Common failure modes

### `Target.createTarget timed out`

Lock contention in the dispatcher. Should not happen on current main. If it does, run with `RUST_LOG=obscura_cdp=trace`, look for handlers that hold `v8_lock` across long awaits.

### `page.goto()` returns `null` from Puppeteer

Means `Network.requestWillBeSent` for the main document did not arrive with `requestId == loaderId`. Check `do_navigate` in `crates/obscura-cdp/src/domains/page.rs`.

### `Cannot find context with specified id`

Playwright's local context counter diverged from the server's `valid_context_ids`. Each navigation must allocate a fresh `executionContextId`. Check `ctx.next_isolated_context()` is called on every nav.

### `V8_Fatal: heap->isolate() == Isolate::TryGetCurrent()`

Two pages tried to use V8 concurrently. The `v8_lock` was bypassed, or a handler suspended a JS runtime while another isolate was entered. Search for direct `JsRuntime` access outside the lock.

### Test hangs

A handler is awaiting something that never resolves. Run with `RUST_LOG=obscura=trace` and check the last log line before the hang.

## Reproducing user bug reports

The integration suite in `tests/test_all.py` is the fastest path from a one-line repro to a regression test. Add the failing case as a new test function, get it failing, then fix.

For Puppeteer / Playwright bug reports, the user's repro script usually drops straight in. Save it as `tests/repro_<issue>.js`, run with `node`, fix until it passes.

### Rendering regressions

Start with the committed deterministic fixtures, then use the representative
real-site suite at both the top and bottom of pages:

```bash
RUN_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)"
OBSCURA_BIN=./target/release/obscura render-repros/run.sh "$RUN_ROOT/fixtures"
OBSCURA_BIN=./target/release/obscura render-repros/representative-suite/run.sh "$RUN_ROOT/top"
OBSCURA_BIN=./target/release/obscura render-repros/representative-suite/run.sh "$RUN_ROOT/bottom" bottom
```

Set `BASELINE_BIN` or `CHROMIUM_BIN` when producing paired captures. Keep the
viewport, user agent, settle policy, scroll position, animation sample, and
capture boundary identical. A pixel-distance score is a regression tripwire,
not a verdict: verify both engines succeeded and produced nonblank output,
then inspect missing resources, geometry, structural edges, and a reduced
fixture. Do not add hostname-specific render branches.

## Profiling

CPU with `perf` and a flamegraph:

```bash
cargo build --release --features render
perf record -F 99 -g -- ./target/release/obscura fetch https://heavy-spa.example
perf script | flamegraph.pl > flame.svg
```

Memory with heaptrack:

```bash
heaptrack ./target/release/obscura serve
```

Tokio task inspection:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build --release --features render
./target/release/obscura serve
# in another shell
tokio-console
```

Requires the workspace `tokio` dependency to be built with the `tracing` feature; not enabled by default, add it in the relevant `Cargo.toml` before profiling.
